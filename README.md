## This is a simple discord bot to archive highly upvoted posts on your discord servers.

On addition to the server the bot will
- Create a channel titled "hall-of-fame"
- Add any posts in your main channels that gain 3 or more upvote reactions (⬆️) to the HOF channel
- It will also play ping pong with you with the !ping command because it's cute

  The bot is given admin permissions to the server
  The hall-of-fame channel can be viewed by all
  The hall-of-fame channel cannot be interacted with by anyone other than the bot
